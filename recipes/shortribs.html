    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Braising is a combination of dry and moist cooking methods where you sear the meat and then bake the meat in a
        liquid.
        It sounds intimidating, but it's actually a very straightforward cooking method and yields delicious results
        that taste gourmet.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 slices bacon, cut into ½-inch pieces</li>
        <li>3 ½ pounds beef short ribs</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>6 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves stripped</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons, all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup dry sherry</li>
        <li>1 quart beef broth</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned,
            about 10 minutes. Transfer crisped bacon with a slotted spoon to a Dutch oven. Keep bacon drippings in the
            skillet.</li>
        <li>Generously season short ribs with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat bacon drippings in the skillet over high heat. Cook short ribs in hot drippings until browned and
            caramelized on all sides, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer ribs to a Dutch oven, reserving drippings in the
            skillet. Add thyme and bay leaf to the Dutch oven. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium. Cook and stir onion in the skillet until soft and golden, 5 to 10 minutes. Add
            garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Whisk flour into onion mixture and stir until mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 1 to 3
            minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour sherry into onion mixture; cook until thick and hot, about 2 minutes. Pour onion-sherry mixture into
            the Dutch oven; pour in beef broth and season with salt. Bring to a simmer and cover the Dutch oven with a
            lid.</li>
        <li>Transfer the Dutch oven to the preheated oven and cook until short ribs are fork-tender, about 2 hours.
            Remove ribs to a serving dish, reserving sauce in the pot.</li>
        <li>Set Dutch oven over high heat and boil sauce until reduced and slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Spoon
            reduced sauce over ribs.</li>
    </ol>
